# Deathwatch And Ascension

Resources and House rules for Deathwatch and high level Dark Heresy one shots.

## General Concept

Allow quicker creation of characters for Deathwatch and high level Dark Heresy games. These documents assume the use of the Deathwatch rule system, but should (when complete) contain everythingthing you need to play the characters created within it (beyond the Deathwatch rulebooks, see bellow). Rules will be brought in from other systems where needed (mostly DH1e). This is hosted on github to allow players, and other GMs to suggest edits and additions, thus allowing the community to grow the game and make the awesomeness that is Warhammer 40,000 RPGs and Deathwatch more accessable.
