# Adding New Attached Operative Organizations

An organisation is a high level template for characters who might work with the Deathwatch. For simplicity's sake it should encompass all the skills, talents, traits and equipment that everyone from that organisation would be expected to have.

### All Organizations Should Have
1. A name.
2.  5 to 2 thematic Characteristics.
3. List of skills that everyone from that organisation would be expected to have at when they have become a master of their trade. Nothing here should be at more than 10.
4. List of talents that everyone from that organisation would be expected to have at when they have become a master of their trade. 
5. Optionally Skill/Talent packages can be given to allow characters to have a secondary area of specialization. Each package should be roughly equivenent in power/XP cost
7. Hit points, to a minimum of 10. The character's specialty will allow them to buy more hit points, so this is the minimum you would expect from a representative of this organisation.
8. Fate Points are a little table to generate starting fate point with a die roll. More pious organisations and those closer to the emperor should have a best chance at getting 4 faith points and no chance to get 2 faith points. Unfeeling or irrefutable organisations should have a greater chance of rolling 3 faith points and no chance of rolling 5 faith points. No-one should be able to start with fewer than 2 faith points and only rolls of a 1 should even possible net you 2 faith points. EG `1=2, 2-5=3, 6-9=4, 10=5`
9. Equipment that is common to all high level members of this organisation. This should generally include some sort of knife or small combat weapon.
10. A special rule that is thematic to this organisation.
11. A specialist use of faith points that is thematic to this organisation.
12. An organisational demeanor.
13. A list of suggested personal demeanors.
14. A link to their specialties document.

**Note**: The experience cost of skills and talents given in steps 3, 4 and 5 need to be calculated. A rough average can be used for 5. This figure will be needed when adding specializations. You can use the bellow table as a guide:
| Not Much Benefit or Situational | Average Skill or Talent | Very Useful or Powerful | Very Useful and Powerful |
|-------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
|               250xp             |            500xp        |           750xp         |         1000xp           |

Other considerations are:
* Theme: If the skill or talent is thematic for these type of character it should have a lower cost. Likewise, in the case of specializations if this
* Prerequisit: If they are a prerequisit for a very powerful ability then they may cost more. If they have a large number of prerequisits then they should cost less.

## Existing Organizations
These organisations are already created. Here are the themes that they follow and the design decisions made in their creation.

### Inquisition 
Inquisition is the organisation that the vast majority of Imperial citizens would work through in order to be attached to the Deathwatch. As such this is the most flexible organisation and should function as a catch all for specializations that don't rightly fit anywhere else. Inquisition members are all experienced investigators of some sort, even if their specialization lies elsewhere.

### Adepta Sororitas
The specializations of the Adepta Sororitas are roughly analogous to a space marine squad. This organisation, in rules this organisation only covers the sisters of battle, and hospatiliters. Others, such as diaglogus, should fit in the Inquisition organisation. Sisters of battle are by far more pious than Astarte, and generally more agile.

### Adeptus Mechanicus
Characters should have the option more armor than a space marine, due to the machine trait, be generally tough and be experts in their field, or even fields of knowledge.

### Adeptus Assassinorum
Assassins should be exceptionally agile and hard to pin down, though not overly tough. They should be experts unrivaled in their primary form of combat. An assassin character should be able to function independently, and those that play these characters should be explicitly told that they will spend a lot of time apart from the kill team, at least physically.
