# Adding New Attached Operative Organisations

An organisation is a high level template for characters who might work with the Deathwatch. For simplicity's sake it should encompase all the skills, talents, traits and equipment that everyone from that organisation would be expected to have.

### All Organisations Should Have
1. A name.
2. +5 to 2 thematic Characteristics.
3. List of skills that everyone from theat organisation would be expected to have at when they have become a master of their trade. Nothing here should be at more than +10.
4. List of talents that everyone from theat organisation would be expected to have at when they have become a master of their trade. 
5. Hitpoints, to a minimum of 10. The character's speciality will allow them to buy more hitpoints, so this is the minimum ylou would expect from a representitive of this organisation.
6. Fate Points are a little table to generate starting fatepoint with a dice roll. More pius organisations and those closer to the emperor should have a best chance at getting 4 faithpoints and no chance to get 2 faith points. Unfeeling or ilreputable organisations should have a greater chance of rolling 3 faith points and no chance of rolling 5 faith points. No-one should be able to start with fewer than 2 faith points and only rolls of a 1 should even posible net you 2 faith points. EG `1=2, 2-5=3, 6-9=4, 10=5`
7. Equipment that is common to all high level members of this organisation. This should generally include some sort of knife or small combat weapon.
8. A special rule that is thematic to this organisation.
9. A specialist use of faith points that is thematic to this organisation.
10. An organisation al demeanor.
11. A list of suggested personal demeanors
12. A link to their specialities document

**Note**: The experience cost of skills and talents given in steps 3 and 4 need to be calculated. This figure will be needed when adding specialisatons. You can use the bellow table as a guide:
| Not Much Benefet or Situational | Average Skill or Talent | Very Useful or Common |   Very Useful   |
|-------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- | --------------- |
|              250xp              |           500xp         |          750xp        |      1000xp     |
Other considerations are:
* Theme: If the skill or talent is thematic for these type of character it should have a lower cost. Likewise, in the case of specialiastions if this...
*
