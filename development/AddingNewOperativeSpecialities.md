# Adding New Attached Operative Specialities

A speciality is an area of expertise that a character will be suited towards. Each speciality should encompass a standard 40K archetype that the Deathwatch may have a requirement to work with. It should encompass as many interesting nuances and interesting subversions of that archetype as possible without breaking it.

## All Specialities Should Have
1. A name
2. A choice between 2 characteristics to get a +5 in
3. A list of skills and talents that everyone from this archetype, at a high level should have gained.
4. An ability to pick X skills and talents from a list. The list should include interesting subversions of the archetype and thematic expensive abilities in a 3:4 ratio.
  - To calculate X take the cost of free skills awarded by the speciality's organization. Add that to the abilities gained in step 3 and divide by 500. X is this number taken from 24. `24 - ((Organization XP + Speciality XP) / 500)`
6. A special rule that is thematic to this speciality.
7. A specialist use of faith points that is thematic to this speciality.
8. A list of equipment packages to allow as many as possible recognizable high level versions of this character as possible
9. A standard Characteristics array
  - There are 2 versions of this array. 2 cheep rows, 7 average costed rows or 3 cheep rows, 2 expensive rows and 4 average ones. The former should only be used for exceptionally flexible archetypes.
  - A cheep advancement row is `200, 500, 1000, 1500`
  - An average advancement row is `500, 1000, 1500, 2000`
  - A expensive advancement row is `750, 1500, 2000, 5000`
10. A list of skill and talent advancements using the table in [AddingNewAttachedOperativeOrganisations](AddingNewAttachedOperativeOrganisations.md) as a guide. 
  - Advancements cost a multiple of 100xp.
  - *Peer(Deathwatch)* if available will be truly useful, and a prerequisite to Deathwatch Indoctrination and should  be costed using 500xp as a guide, before how thematic is factored in.
  - *Deathwatch Indoctrination* always costs 1200xp, thus closing its availability to starting characters.
  - *Untouchable* uses 700xp as a guide, before how thematic is factored in.
  - *Terrifying Truths* allow characters who are not strong, but still are scary, to intimidate. It is basically is a fix and thus should be cheap for archetypes that fit that bill.
  - *Sound Constitution* is the speciality's only way to increase their hit points over those given in the organization (which is a low average). If the archetype is at all tough, he should have some cheep choices here.
  - The total HP that can be gained by purchasing *Sound Constitution*, should be no more than 22
