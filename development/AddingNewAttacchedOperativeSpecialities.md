# Adding New Attacched Operative Specialities

A speciality is an area of expertise that a character will be suited towards. Each speciality should emcumpase a standard 40K architype that the deathwatch may nave a requirement to work with. It should encumbase as many interesting nuances and interesting subversions of that architype as posible without breaking it.

## All Specialities Should Have
1. A name
2. A choice between 2 characteristics to get a a +5 in
3. A list of skills and talents that everyone from this architype, at a high level should have gained.
4. An ability to pick X skills and tallents from a list. The list should include interesting subversions of the architype and thematic expencive abilities in a 3:4 ratio.
  - To calculate X take the cost of fress skills awarded by the speciality's organisation. Add that to the abilites gained in step 3 and devide by 500. X is this number taken from 24. `24 - ((Organisation XP + Speciality XP) / 500)`
6. A special rule that is thematic to this speciality.
7. A specialist use of faith points that is thematic to this speciality.
8. A list of equipment packages to allow as many as posible recognisable high level versions of this character as posible
9. A standard Characteristics array
  - There are 2 versions of this array. 2 cheep rows, 7 average costed rows or 3 cheep rows, 2 expensive rows and 4 average ones. The former should only be used for execptionally flexable architypes.
  - A cheep advancemant row is `200,	500,	1000,	1500`
  - An average advancemant row is `500,	1000,	1500,	2000`
  - A expensive advancemant row is `750,	1500,	2000,	5000`
10. A list of skill and talent advancements using the table in [AddingNewAttachedOperativeOrganisations](AddingNewAttachedOperativeOrganisations.md) as a guide. 
  - Advancements cost a multiple of 100xp.
  - *Peer(Deathwatch)* if available will be truely useful, and a prerequisit to Deathwatch Indoctrination and should  be costed using 500xp as a guide, before how thematic is factored in.
  - *Deathwatch Indoctrination* always costs 1200xp, thus closing it's availability to starting characters.
  - *Untouchable* uses 700xp as a guide, before how thematic is factored in.
  - *Terifying Truths* allow characters who are not strong, but still are scary, to intimidate. It is basically is a fix and thus should be cheep for architypes that fit that bill.
  - *Sound Constitution* is the specialitity's only way to increase their hit points over those given in the organisation (which is a low average). If the archytype is at all tough, he should have some cheep choices here.
  - The total HP that can be gained by purchasing *Sound Constitution*, should be no more than 22

## Noteworthy Existing Specialities
Some thoughts on the design of some unusual existing specialities

### Inquisition

#### Interigator
The interogater has access to high level connections and a great ability to interogate, but in general he's just a bag of unexpected tricks. The interigator should be the most flexable speciality of the most flexable organisation.  
Really, I like Interogators a lot more than Inquisitors, as they don't have the same ability to come in and start ordering everyone around, thus changing the entire dynamic of the kill team.

#### Savage Champion
This is a catch all speciality for people who wish to play characters slightly oustside or oblivious to the greater imperium. More importantly, it should be a way to make a character that is oblivious to the greater imperium, thus accessable to those with no knowledge of the 40K lore. It should allow reasonable fantasy and contempary architypes to be playable.

#### Storm Trooper
Not only should this cover storm troopers, but it should be flexable enough to work as an experienced member of any regiment or standard Imperial Standing force. EG PDF, palace guards, tau empire rebels, etc

### Adeptus Sororitas

## Celestian
All the tactical flexability of a tactical marine with little of the command ability. A celestian may inspire a rabble to action, but her primary role is to bring death to the enemy, and engage their weaknesses.
