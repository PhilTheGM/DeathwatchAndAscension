# House Rules

A collection of suggested house rules to make play faster and more fun!

## Characteristics Array Method
Thake the following array and add 6 points increasing no number above 20:

`2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18`

The resulting figures may be added to your characteristics in any order you wish.

## Chapter Selection
One chapter from each founding only. Obviously an unlimited number of choices from Unknown Foundings, though only one from each chapter.

## Gear Swapping
Where it makes sence for the character, players are allowed to swap out starting wargear (AKA standard issue wargear) with others of simular power level. Of course the GM has final say on what is or isn't an acceptable swap. An example of this can be found in the armour section of the [Deathwatch Character Creation Guide](DeathwatchCharacterCreationGuide.md).

### Exceptable Examples
 * Carcharodon Assault Marine with a chain axe instead of a chainsword
 * Salamanders Devastator with a heavy flamer instead of a heavy bolter

### Unacceptable Examples
 * Salamanders Devastator with a multi-melta instead of a heavy bolter

## Infinity Reloads
As an experienced and elite team, you are always considered to have brought enough amunition to get the job done. Unless the secnario dictates otherwise, your character always has another reload for all basic and pistol weapons. Only heavy weapons and grenades require the player to track reloads.

## Storm Weapons can Suppress
Storm Weapons can be used for suppressing fire, following all the rules for suppressing fire that full auto weapons do. A hit using a storm weapon with suppressing fire, not on full auto, does not count as two hits.

## Hit Location Chart
The hit location rules that came with the origional Dark Heresy 2 Beta (which was sinse scrapped) is faster and  easier to remember. In this system you take the units dice of your to-hit roll and compaire them to the bellow chart.
1=Head, 2=Left Arm, 3=Right Arm, 4-6=Chest, 7-8=Left Leg, 9-0=Right Leg.

## Errata
The [Deathwatch Errata](DeathwatchErrata.pdf) fix a lot of issues and speed up play. They are highly recomended!
