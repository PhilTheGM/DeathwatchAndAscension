# Attached Operative Mission Preparation
This document describes the actions of any Attached Operatives during the mission preparation and rewards.

## Preparation
### Briefing
Attacked Operatives are briefed alongside the kill team. The deathwatch usually sees the advantage in having all members of the team fully briefed in all aspects of the mission so that they may aid each other. This, however, may not always be the case depending on any number of factors, any members of the mission may be given secret missions or information not privy to rest of the team.  
Likewise, questions can be fielded from both astartes and mortals equally, though care should be taken by all to be respectful. It is not always the case that those who have been invited to a briefing are absolutely set to be sent on the mission. In cases when an individual or group appears incapable of functioning in the selected team they can be reassigned and replaced at a moment's notice. The mission is more important than the individual.

### Selecting a Leader
This is completely the purview of the kill team. Input from those not on the team, regardless of rank, knowledge, affiliation or any other factor will rarely be taken well by the team.

### Oath-Taking
Attached operatives with the *"Deathwatch Indoctrination"* talent may be allowed to make suggestions, but it is considered no slight for the kill team to completely ignore this suggestion in favor of their own counsel, regardless of the authority of the operative.

### Arming
Attached operatives have a separate pool of requisition points to the kill team. This is calculated as 1/4 of the kill team's points, rounding up. Largely this can be used to requisition equipment found in the [Wargear document](Wargear.md). It cannot be used to requisition weaponry designed for astartes. At the game master's discretion scaled down astartes tools may be available for use by an attached operative at the standard cost, and rank requirements. 

## Rewards
Attached operatives receive renown and experience in the exact same manner as space marines. Operatives may seek renown in other ways than astartes, generally using their own specialized skills and ingenuity over rather than direct aggressive action.
