# Attached Operatives

Attached opertatives are members of organisations other that the Deathwatch who have been assigned to join the kill team to complete a particular objective. Whatever their purpose, they are trusted to work allong side a team of astarties, by the watch captain and are thus above and beyond the most common citizenship of the imperium. They are trained and equiped as elite members of their respective organisations.

## Character Creation
Creation of an attached operative is a much faster simplier affair than an astartes. The following seven steps are all you need to do.

### 1 - Characteristic Generation
Characteristic are generated in the same manner as an astartes charateristics (Deathwatch Core pg25-26). However, operatives add their figures to 25, rather than 30. `Note there is an alternative Characteristic Generation method presented in the House Rules document`

### 3 - Choose an Organisation
Available organisations can be found bellow and come with a great deal of choices to customise your character. Your organisation will give you skills talents, equipment, some special rules and the number of fate points you begin with. It also dictates what specialities you may choose from.

### 2 - Choose a Demeanors
Operatives can add any demeanor they feel suit, however there is a list of suggested demeanors within the operatives choosen organisation. Aditionally an opperative's "Chapter Demeanor" is set by his Organisation.

### 4 - Choose a Speciality
Your organisation wil contain a link to the correct speciality document. The speciality will dictate what your character's role in the team is. It will also add to your skills, talents and special rules. From your speciality you will gain the bulk of your equipment. Your speciality my start you with some experience or corruption. If not both of these figures start at 0.

### 5 - Spend Experience
The skills, talents equipment and other benifets that you have recieved thus far in character creation bring your experience total to 12000, in line with a starting space marine. Just like a space marine you have aditional experience you may spend. This is in line with what the astartes recieve, usually another 1000xp. You may spend this experience in the progression tables within your speciality or in the Deathwatch advances (Deathwatch Core pg64-65). It's worth noting that the speciality advances are not segregated, thus operative can quickly outstrip their astartes counterparts in a small number of areas.

### 6 - Past
This is a one line description of a defining past event. These could be anything from "Stole an inquisitorial Rosetta" to "Destroyed a deamon by learning it's true name". You may work with your GM to create one. Your character's past is a lightweight roleplaying aid, and confers no mechanical benifit.

### 7 - Rank
Although the advancment chart is not segregated by rank, operatives rank increases in the same manner as Astartes. Usually it will star at 1, but if your GM has given you extra experience, refer to table 2-2 in Deathwatch Core pg58.
