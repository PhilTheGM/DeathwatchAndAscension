# Attached Operative Talents

### Deathwatch Indoctrination
**Prerequisite**: Peer(Deathwatch) 
Be it through indoctrination, training, or the pure amount of time you have spent fighting alongside Astarte of the Deathwatch, you can on occasion benefit from their squad tactics. You can enter squad mode just like an Astarte. Any codex squad mode initiated by the squad leader can be used by your operative if the squad leader succeeds on a challenging (0) `Command` test.  
While in squad mode you my not use any specialized usage of fate points given to you by your organisation or specialty. You also my not use faith powers. Your character is so in tune with the movements of the gods of death that they are fighting with that it is impossible to focus on their more complex abilities.

### Chapter Indoctrination
**Prerequisite**: Deathwatch Indoctrination
You have become attuned to the battlefield behaviour of a certain space marine chapter. You may choose chapter one squad mode associated with a chapter that you have previously fought alongside and treat it as a codex squad mode for the purposes of the Deathwatch Indoctrination talent.

### Terrifying Truths
You can use `Fel` instead of `S` for intimidation tests.

### Unremarkable 
You have a forgettable face and are able to blend in with a crowd. Attempts to notice you when amongst other people or anyone attempting to describe you or recall details about you incurs a –20 penalty.

### Untouchable

Having lived with this condition for any period of time, you learn to adapt your deceptions to suit. You may now use `Int` for `Deceive` tests instead of `Fel`

**The Untouchable and the Profane**:
An untouchable (thanks to his special nature) is spared some of both the perils of interaction with the Warp and some of its potential powers and benifits. An untouchable may not for example, under any normal circumstances enter into a Dark Pact with a warp entity or receive the benefits of beneficial psychic powers, sorcery or true faith. They may not learn sorcery or take any talents associated with it and may not have faith talents (see pages 50-51 of T he I nquisitor ’ s Handbook ). A force weapon, daemon weapon, or occult artefact (or the like) in the hands of an untouchable is merely a weapon or object of its type. The untouchable may not unleash or benefit from any of the weapon’s special powers or abilities, or (in the case of a daemon weapon) master it. However, the same also applies to such items and weapons used against the untouchable. Other than base damage listed (a sword in the guts is still a sword in the guts after all) any other particular effect such a weapon would normally have on the untouchable is likewise ignored.  
Because of their unique place in the universe of Warhammer 40,000, untouchables in games may bring up odd questions about their nature in the rules and options such characters may take. In all cases it is up to the GM’s own good sense and judgment to decide how they are handled.
