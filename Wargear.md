#### Las Weapon Variable Setting
The standard basic or pistol las weapon has a variable setting option, allowing it to fire higher-powered bursts. It may be set to overcharge mode, dealing +1 damage, but using two shots worth of ammunition per shot fired. Further, the weapon may be set to overload mode, dealing +2 damage and gaining +2 penetration. In this case, it uses four shots of ammunition per shot fired, loses Reliable, and gains Unreliable.
